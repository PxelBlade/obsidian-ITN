## You can access the internet through...
- Computers
- Network Adapters
- But ultimately through [[Vocabulary|ISPs]], which have their pros and cons:
	- Used in personal, work, and school environments.
	- Requires unique login (UID)
	- Can be a direct connection (cable, DSL, fiber) or dial-up (phone modem)
## Other Info
- [[Vocabulary|ISPs]] control access to the internet, no one else. Companies like Spectrum, T-Mobile, and Verizon essentially control who can access the internet. There is no such thing as "free" when it comes to accessing the internet.
- There are multiple layers of the internet, shown below:
	- **Surface/light web:** Anything that can be accessed via a search engine is considered this.
	- **Deep web:** The term used for a group of websites requiring specific access, such as an account or other type of security.
	- **Dark Web:** The most widespread part of the internet. This can only be accessed via a special type of protocol called Onion, and due to that, many use the dark web for illegal purposes.
