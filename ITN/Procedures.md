## Unplugging a computer
1. Unplug power
2. Unplug network (if applicable)
3. Unplug all other peripherals
4. Clear board power by holding the power button for ~5 seconds.
## Troubleshooting Tips
- If a device in the front fails, plug it in the back.
- 80% of all problems can be fixed with a reboot (did you turn it off and on again?)
- Always tag out a device you're working on
